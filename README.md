# The_Programmer_2_Java
A sequel to the first The Programmer done using a tutorial and coded in Java. Just a platformer, no enemies or bosses this time. Kind of glitchy towards the end of the game. No story either, sequels aren't always that great :P
Apologies I can't seem to get a working version of the executable out, it was done in eclipse, it's possible to import the project into the workspace and run it like that.
